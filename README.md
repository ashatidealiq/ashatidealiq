ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ash

Iâ€™m interested in machine learning and data engineering projects, and software dev generally. 

I'm mostly self taught and primarily a data and AI guy, but I've been at this a while. 

I've got lots of experience in business and building systems generally - specifically  designing large complex layouts in capital markets, trade pricing and execution strategies, quantitative trading and statistical arbitrage, streaming valuation pipelines, messaging integration... stuff like that.
 
Iâ€™m interested in collaborating on deep learning projects - esp in finance and financial markets. Even property (lots of innovation to do there) and crypto markets (from a tech perspective at least.) If you're doing something in this space and you need help I would love to connect! 

I'm currently working on a few passion projects in the data engineering space including a deep learning ensemble that filters signal from noise in financial markets, a two-sided securitizaton marketplace that helps BTR property developers raise cash, and a founder focused startup incubator for fintech, biotech and proptech (yes, I can probably help you raise capital if you need help). 

My freelance day job is solving business & data challenges for broker-dealers and investment funds.
 
ðŸ“« I would love to hear from you on ash@idealiq.co or here on Github.

A short note on the demos here: they're demos. There's a lot more you can and should do before rolling any of these out into production.
