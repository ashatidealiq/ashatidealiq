👋 Hi, I’m Ash

I’m interested in machine learning and data engineering projects, and software dev generally. 

I'm mostly self taught and primarily a data guy, but I've been at this a while. I was a programmer > turned banker > turned back to programmer. 

I've got lots of experience in business and building systems generally. Specifically large complex layouts in capital markets, trade pricing and execution strategies, streaming valuation pipelines, messaging integration... stuff like that.
 
I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning projects. I'm particularly interested in finance and financial markets. Even property and crypto markets (from a tech perspective at least) If you're doing something in this space and you need help I would love to connect! 

I'm currently working on a few projects in the retail lending space in Australia, and solving problems for investment managers - if you're curious get in touch.
