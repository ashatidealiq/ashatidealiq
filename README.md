👋 Hi, I’m Ash

I’m interested in machine learning and data engineering projects, and software dev generally. 

I'm mostly self taught and primarily a data and AI guy, but I've been at this a while. I was a programmer > turned banker > turned back to programmer. 

I've got lots of experience in business and building systems generally. Specifically large complex layouts in capital markets, trade pricing and execution strategies, streaming valuation pipelines, messaging integration... stuff like that.
 
I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning projects. I'm particularly interested in finance and financial markets. Even property and crypto markets (from a tech perspective at least.) If you're doing something in this space and you need help I would love to connect! 

I'm currently working on a few passion projects in the data engineering space. If you're curious there are a few demos below, otherwise get in touch. 

My freelance day job is solving AI and data problems, and fast prototyping smart solutions for investment managers, funds and fintechs.
 
📫 I would love to hear from you on ash@idealiq.co or here on Github.
